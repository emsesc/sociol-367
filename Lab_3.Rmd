[**Lab Instructions**](https://dssoc.github.io/assignments/lab_instructions.html)

In this lab we will practice using the `ggplot2` library to create visualizations of our data. **Our standard for visualizations is that each plot should have axis labels, all labels must be readable to someone unfamiliar with your data (e.g. Female and Male instead of `F` and `M`, Senator and Representative instead of `rep` and `sen`), and we should easily be able to tell what your figure is showing. Failure to do this will result in point deductions.**

See the "Instructions" section of the [Introduction to Lab Assignments](https://dssoc.github.io/assignments/lab_instructions.html) page for more information about the labs. That page also gives descriptions for the datasets we will be using.

## Example Questions

<br>

**ex1. make a bar chart showing the number of male and female members of congress in our dataset.**

```{r}
congress %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=gender)) +
    geom_bar()
```

<br/>

**ex2. make a bar chart showing the proportion of female senators in each pol.**

```{r}
congress %>% 
  group_by(party) %>% 
  summarize(proportion_gender=mean(gender=='F')) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=party, y=proportion_gender)) +
    geom_bar(stat='identity', position='dodge')
```

<br/>

## Questions

<br>

**1. Describe the functionality of each of the following functions:**

```         
group_by: Groups variables in a column, orders in ascending order to be used to aggregate data using summarise(); doesn't produce any output on its own. (ex: to calculuate the mean of each country, you can group_by country and then pipe into summarise.)
summarise: Creates a new data frame and returns rows that combines the grouped variables of summary data.
inner_join: Keeps observations from one data frame that have a matching observation in another data frame
left_join: Keeps observations that are in the first data frame
ggplot: Takes in data to create plots
```

<br/>

**2. Create a bar plot to show the average ages of congress members from each political party. Now do the same for M and F genders.**

```{r}
congress %>%
  group_by(party) %>% 
  summarize(proportion_age=mean(2024 - birthyear)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=party, y=proportion_age)) +
    geom_bar(stat='identity', position='dodge')

congress %>%
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarize(proportion_gender=mean(2024 - birthyear)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=gender, y=proportion_gender)) +
    geom_bar(stat='identity', position='dodge')
```

<br/>

**3. Create a line graph showing the total number of congress member births in each decade since the 1930's, with separate lines for senate and house members (see the `type` column). The labels on your x-axis should look like "1930's", "1940's", and so on, and your legend should show names "Senator" and "Representative" (i.e. not `rep` and `sen`).**

Note: The plotted lines may not show up in decades where there were no births - that is okay.

```{r}
congress %>%
  mutate(decade = sprintf("%d's", floor(birthyear/10)*10)) %>%
  count(decade, type) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=decade, y=n, color=type, group=type)) +
  xlab("Decade") +
	ylab("Count") +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_colour_manual("Type",values=c("coral", "cyan4"), labels=c("Representative","Senator"))



```

<br/>

**4. Create a bar chart showing the average ages of Senators and Representatives separately by weekday. The plot should make it easy to compare Senators and Representatives within each weekday. The x-labels should be weekday names and appear in chronological order.**

NOTE: For convenience, I have already parsed the `birthdate` column into a `date` type.

NOTE: the final plot should have 14 bars: 7 weekdays by 2 types of congress members (Senators and Representatives).

HINT: see the Optional Readings for more information about grouped bar charts using `ggplot2`.

```{r}
congress %>%
  mutate(weekday=weekdays(birthdate)) %>%
  group_by(type, weekday) %>%
  summarize(proportion_age=mean(2024 - birthyear)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill=type, y=proportion_age, x=weekday)) + 
  geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity") +
  scale_fill_manual("Type",values=c("coral", "cyan4"), labels=c("Representative","Senator")) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")) +
  ylab("Average Age") +
  xlab("Day of the Week")

# mapping FILL aesthetic
```

<br/>

**5. Use an inner join to combine the columns of the `congress` dataframe with the columns of `congress_contacts` and show the average proportion of congress members with valid Facebook accounts by gender.**

HINT: you will want to join the dataframes based on a column that is common to both datasets.

```{r}
congress %>%
  inner_join(congress_contact, by="bioguide_id") %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(prop_facebook_valid = mean(facebook !=''))
  
```

<br/>

**6. Create a bar chart comparing the average age of congress members that have valid Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube accounts. Each bar should correspond to a social media platform and the height should correspond to the average age of congress members with that type of account.**

HINT: one way to accomplish this is by using gather to create a separate row for each person-account, and summarize to average by age.

```{r}
congress %>%
  inner_join(congress_contact, by="bioguide_id") %>%
  gather(key=platform, value=username, twitter, facebook, youtube) %>%
  group_by(platform) %>%
  filter(username!='') %>%
  summarise(average_age = mean(2024-birthyear)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=platform, y=average_age)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity', position='dodge')
```

<br/>

**7. The remainder of problems in this homework will involve the use of the `committees.RData` dataset. Create a plot showing the average number of subcommittees that congress members belong to by gender.**

HINT: as described in the Lab Instructions page, you will need to perform a join between the `subcommittees` and `committee_memberships` dataframes to get ONLY subcommittee (and not committee) memberships. You may copy-paste the code from the Lab Instructions page if that would be helpful.

HINT: you should perform a join to get ONLY subcommittee (and not committee) memberships. Refer to the Lab Instructions page for more information about this dataset.

```{r}
subcommittees %>% 
  inner_join(committee_memberships, by="thomas_id") %>%
  right_join(congress, by="bioguide_id") %>%
  group_by(full_name, gender) %>%
  summarise(num_membership = sum(!is.na(name))) %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(avg_subcommittee_membership = mean(num_membership)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=gender, y=avg_subcommittee_membership)) +
    geom_bar(stat='identity', position='dodge')
```

</br>

**8. Create a bar plot showing the number of members that belong to the 5 largest full congressional committees (i.e. full committees with the largest number of members). The bars should be sorted based on committee sizes.**

NOTE: read the Lab Instructions page for more information about the standards for visualizations in this course. The full committee names should appear somewhere on the plot - please do not provide `thomas_id`s only (you may include full committee names in the legend though).

```{r}
committees %>% 
  inner_join(committee_memberships, by="thomas_id") %>%
  count(thomas_id) %>%
  top_n(5, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill=thomas_id, x=reorder(thomas_id, -n), y=n)) +
    geom_bar(stat='identity', position='dodge') +
    scale_fill_manual("Full Committees", 
                      values=c("coral", "cyan4", "springgreen4", "steelblue", "tomato3"), 
                      breaks = c("HSPW", "HSAS", "HSAP", "HSIF", "HSBA"),
                      labels=c("House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure","House Committee on Armed Services", "House Committee on Appropriations", "House Committee on Energy and Commerce", "House Committee on Financial Services"))
```

<br/>

**9. Create a single bar plot that shows the average age of the full committees with the 5 highest and lowest average ages. The bars should be sorted based on average committee ages.**

This means you will need to join three dataframes: `committee_memberships` for membership information, `committees` to separate full committees from subcommittees and get committee names, and `congress` to get age information.
